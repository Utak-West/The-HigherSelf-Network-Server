This is automatically configured to your HigherSelf Network Server directory:
```

## üîß Complete Augment Code Configuration

Here's your complete MCP server configuration with placeholders for your actual credentials:

```json
{
  "augment.advanced": {
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "name": "notion-higherself",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion"],
        "env": {
          "NOTION_TOKEN": "secret_your_actual_notion_token_here"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "github-higherself",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_actual_github_token_here"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "brave-search-higherself",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
        "env": {
          "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your_actual_brave_api_key_here"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "filesystem-higherself",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/utakwest/Documents/HigherSelf/The HigherSelf Network /The HigherSelf Network Server"],
        "env": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Setup

After configuring your credentials:

1. **Restart Augment Code completely**
2. **Wait 30 seconds** for MCP servers to initialize
3. **Test with these queries**:

### Test Notion Integration:
```
"Show me my Notion databases"
"List contacts in my Business Entities database"
"How many contacts do I have across all databases?"
```

### Test GitHub Integration:
```
"List my GitHub repositories"
"Show recent commits in The-HigherSelf-Network-Server"
"What files are in my main repository?"
```

### Test Brave Search:
```
"Search for art gallery marketing trends"
"Find information about wellness center automation"
"Research consulting business best practices"
```

### Test File System:
```
"List files in my HigherSelf Network Server directory"
"Show me the contents of my agents folder"
"What documentation files do I have?"
```

## üö® Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Tokens:
- ‚úÖ Never share tokens in screenshots or public repositories
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- ‚úÖ Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days)
- ‚úÖ Limit token permissions to minimum required scope

### Monitor Usage:
- üìä Check API usage in each service's dashboard
- üîç Monitor for unusual activity
- üìù Keep track of which applications have access

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Invalid token" errors:**
- Double-check you copied the complete token
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Verify the token hasn't expired

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- For Notion: Ensure integration has access to specific databases
- For GitHub: Check token scopes include required permissions
- For file system: Verify directory path is correct

**"Server not found" errors:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify package names are correct
- Try restarting Augment Code
