## For Developers

### System Architecture

The HigherSelf Network Server implements a hub-and-spoke architecture with Notion as the central hub:

#### Key Components

1. Models (`/models`): Pydantic models defining data structures
2. Services (`/services`): Service classes for external API interactions
3. Agents (`/agents`): Agent implementations with specific responsibilities
4. API (`/api`): FastAPI server for external communication

#### Data Flow

1. External events trigger webhook calls to the API
2. Events are processed by appropriate agents
3. Agents create or update records in Notion via the NotionService
4. Workflow instances track the state of business processes
5. History logs maintain a complete audit trail

#### API Endpoints

The server exposes several API endpoints for integration with external systems:

| Platform | Endpoint                        | Description                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| N8N      | `/api/external/n8n/callback`    | Receives workflow data from N8N    |
| Zapier   | `/api/external/zapier/callback` | Receives workflow data from Zapier |

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create a new file in the `agents` directory
2. Extend the `BaseAgent` class
3. Implement the required abstract methods
4. Register the agent in `agents/__init__.py`
5. Add initialization in `main.py`

```python
from agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

class MyNewAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    My new agent that handles specific tasks.
    """

    def __init__(self, notion_client, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name="MyNewAgent", notion_client=notion_client, **kwargs)
        self.agent_type = "MyNewAgentType"

    async def process_event(self, event_type: str, event_data: dict) -> dict:
        """Process an event received by this agent."""
        # Implementation here
        return {"status": "processed"}

    async def check_health(self) -> dict:
        """Check the health status of this agent."""
        return {"status": "healthy"}
```

### Adding a New Integration

To add support for a new integration:

1. Add the API platform to `ApiPlatform` enum in `models/base.py`
2. Create new Pydantic models for the integration's data structures
3. Create a new service class in the `services` directory
4. Implement a new agent or extend an existing one
5. Add webhook endpoints if needed

```python
# 1. Add to ApiPlatform enum
class ApiPlatform(str, Enum):
    # Existing platforms...
    MY_NEW_PLATFORM = "my_new_platform"

# 2. Create service class
class MyNewPlatformService(BaseService):
    """Service for interacting with My New Platform."""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(service_name="my_new_platform")
        # Initialize service

    async def validate_connection(self) -> bool:
        """Validate the connection to the service."""
        # Implementation here
        return True
```
