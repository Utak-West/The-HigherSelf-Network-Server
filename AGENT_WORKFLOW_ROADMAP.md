# Agent Workflow Roadmap

## Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive roadmap for agents within The HigherSelf Network server ecosystem. It outlines the interactions, workflows, and communication patterns between various specialized agents in the system, providing a clear understanding of how these agents collaborate to accomplish tasks and deliver value to users. This roadmap is designed to guide developers, system architects, and stakeholders in understanding the agent-based architecture that powers The HigherSelf Network.

The agent ecosystem is built on a foundation of specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities and capabilities, working together through standardized message formats and workflow patterns. This document illustrates these patterns and serves as a reference for current implementation and future expansion of the agent system.

## Ruvo: Task Management Agent

Ruvo serves as the central task orchestrator within The HigherSelf Network ecosystem. This specialized agent is responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of tasks across the system, from creation to completion, ensuring proper task tracking, delegation, and status updates.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Task Creation and Management**: Processes incoming task requests, creates structured task entries, and manages tasks through their complete lifecycle
- **Workflow Event Processing**: Handles workflow-related events, triggering appropriate task creation and updates based on workflow state changes
- **Task Template Management**: Applies predefined task templates to ensure consistency and completeness in task creation
- **Task Assignment**: Manages the assignment of tasks to appropriate agents or human users
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains current status information for all tasks in the system
- **Workflow Integration**: Interfaces with external workflow systems like N8N and Zapier to trigger actions based on task status changes
- **Notion Database Integration**: Maintains task records in Notion databases for visibility and tracking

Ruvo's position as the task orchestration agent makes it a critical component in ensuring that work flows smoothly between different agents and systems within The HigherSelf Network ecosystem.

- **Event Triggers**: Internal system events that initiate agent workflows
- **Scheduled Triggers**: Time-based events that execute scheduled workflows
- **External Webhooks**: Integration points that allow third-party systems to trigger workflows

### Central Orchestration

- **Grace (System Orchestrator)**: The central coordination agent that routes events to appropriate specialized agents

## Agent Communication Examples

Agents in The HigherSelf Network communicate using structured JSON messages that follow a consistent format. These messages include sender and recipient information, timestamps, unique identifiers, and a payload containing the specific data relevant to the message type. Below are examples of common communication patterns between agents:

### 1. Ruvo to GraceOrchestrator - Workflow Status Update

When a workflow transitions to a new state, Ruvo sends an update to the Grace orchestrator:

```json
{
  "message_type": "workflow_status_update",
  "sender": {
    "agent_id": "TASK_MANAGEMENT_AGENT",
    "agent_name": "Ruvo"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "agent_id": "GRACE_ORCHESTRATOR",
    "agent_name": "Grace Fields"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-05-17T11:23:52Z",
  "message_id": "msg-8a72d9c1e4b5",
  "payload": {
    "workflow_instance_id": "WFI-7823ADEF",
    "previous_state": "lead_qualification",
    "new_state": "onboarding_process",
    "business_entity_id": "BE-TCP-001",
    "transition_timestamp": "2025-05-17T11:23:48Z",
    "triggered_by": "task_completion",
    "task_id": "TSK-9284CFAE"
  }
}
```

In this example, Ruvo informs Grace that a workflow has transitioned from the "lead_qualification" state to the "onboarding_process" state. This transition was triggered by the completion of a specific task, and includes identifiers for the related business entity and workflow instance.

### 2. Ruvo to Elan - Content Task Delegation

When a content-related task needs to be created, Ruvo delegates it to Elan, the Content Choreographer:

```json
{
  "message_type": "task_delegation",
  "sender": {
    "agent_id": "TASK_MANAGEMENT_AGENT",
    "agent_name": "Ruvo"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "agent_id": "CONTENT_LIFECYCLE_AGENT",
    "agent_name": "Elan"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-05-17T11:24:30Z",
  "message_id": "msg-5e62a8b7c9d3",
  "payload": {
    "task_id": "TSK-7236DEFC",
    "task_name": "Create Onboarding Email Sequence",
    "task_template_id": "TPL-EMAIL-003",
    "priority": "High",
    "due_date": "2025-05-24T17:00:00Z",
    "workflow_instance_id": "WFI-7823ADEF",
    "business_entity_id": "BE-TCP-001",
    "client_id": "CL-5642ABCD",
    "metadata": {
      "content_type": "email_sequence",
      "required_attachments": ["welcome_guide", "service_overview"],
      "target_audience_segment": "new_members",
      "campaign_id": "CAM-2025-05-ONBOARD"
    },
    "checklist_items": [
      "Research client background",
      "Draft welcome email",
      "Create follow-up sequence",
      "Add personalization tokens",
      "QA test sequence"
    ]
  }
}
```

This message demonstrates a task delegation from Ruvo to Elan, providing structured details about a content creation task. The message includes comprehensive information about the task purpose, requirements, deadlines, and related business context, allowing Elan to understand the full scope of the task without requiring additional context.

## Conclusion

This agent workflow roadmap provides a foundation for understanding how agents interact within The HigherSelf Network ecosystem. By following standardized communication patterns and clearly defined responsibilities, these agents work together to create a cohesive, intelligent system capable of handling complex business processes.

The diagram and examples presented in this document serve as a template for current implementation and future expansion of the agent-based architecture. As the system evolves, additional agents, integrations, and communication patterns may be added, but they should follow the principles and structures outlined in this roadmap.
