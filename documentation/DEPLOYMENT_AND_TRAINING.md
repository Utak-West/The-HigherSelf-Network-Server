## Deployment Options

The HigherSelf Network Server can be deployed in several ways:

### 1. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker provides the most consistent and isolated environment for running the server. This is the recommended approach for production deployments.

**Requirements:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Access to the Docker Hub registry
- 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
- 10GB disk space minimum

### 2. Direct Python Deployment

For development or testing, you can run the server directly with Python.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 5GB disk space minimum

### 3. Cloud Deployment

For scalable production deployments, consider cloud platforms:

**Options:**
- AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Instances
- Digital Ocean App Platform

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Utak-West/The-HigherSelf-Network-Server.git
cd The-HigherSelf-Network-Server
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and edit it with your specific values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

**Critical Variables to Configure:**

- `NOTION_API_TOKEN`: Your Notion integration API token
- `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID`: ID of the parent page for database creation
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Secret for securing webhook endpoints
- All API credentials for integrated services

### 3. SSL Certificate Setup (Production)

For production deployments, set up SSL certificates:

```bash
mkdir -p deployment/ssl
# Place your SSL certificates in this directory:
# - deployment/ssl/cert.pem
# - deployment/ssl/key.pem
```

You can use Let's Encrypt to generate free SSL certificates:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
```

## Notion Integration Setup

The HigherSelf Network Server uses Notion as its central hub. Follow these steps to set up the Notion integration:

### 1. Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name it "HigherSelf Network Server"
4. Select the workspace where you want to create the databases
5. Set appropriate capabilities (Read content, Update content, Insert content)
6. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" and add it to your `.env` file as `NOTION_API_TOKEN`

### 2. Create a Parent Page

1. Create a new page in your Notion workspace
2. Share this page with your integration (click "Share" â†’ select your integration)
3. Copy the page ID from the URL (the part after the workspace name and before the question mark)
4. Add this ID to your `.env` file as `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID`

### 3. Initialize Notion Databases

Run the database setup utility to create all required databases:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker-compose run --rm windsurf-agent python -m tools.notion_db_setup

# Using Python directly
python -m tools.notion_db_setup
```

This will create 16 interconnected databases in your Notion workspace and update your `.env` file with their IDs.

## Deployment Steps

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build and start the containers:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Verify the deployment:**

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

3. **For production deployment:**

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Direct Python Deployment

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the server:**

```bash
python main.py
```

### Cloud Deployment

For AWS ECS deployment:

1. **Build and push the Docker image:**

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name higherself-network-server
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker build -t <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/higherself-network-server:latest .
docker push <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/higherself-network-server:latest
```

2. **Create an ECS cluster and service using the AWS console or CLI**
