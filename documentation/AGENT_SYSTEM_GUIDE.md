## Working with Agents in Notion

Agents interact with you primarily through Notion databases. Here's how to work with them:

### Agent Registry Database

This database contains all registered agents and their current status. You can:
- View agent capabilities and APIs utilized
- Check agent status and version
- See which business entities each agent is associated with

### Agent Communication Database

This database records all communications between agents. You can:
- Review agent messages and decisions
- Track the flow of information through the system
- Understand how agents collaborate on workflows

### Workflow Instances Database

This database contains all active workflows. You can:
- See which agent initiated each workflow
- Track the current status of workflows
- View the history log of actions taken
- Add manual notes or instructions for agents

### Tasks Database

This database contains all tasks created by agents. You can:
- Assign or reassign tasks
- Update task status
- Add comments or additional information
- Set or modify due dates

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate with each other through a structured message bus system. All communications are recorded in the Agent Communication database in Notion for transparency and auditability.

### Message Types

- **Event Notifications**: Alerts about external events (new lead, booking, etc.)
- **Task Assignments**: Requests to create or complete tasks
- **Data Updates**: Notifications about changes to shared data
- **Workflow Transitions**: Signals about workflow stage changes
- **Queries**: Requests for information from other agents
- **Responses**: Replies to queries with requested information

### Communicating with Agents

Staff can communicate with agents in several ways:

1. **Through Notion Comments**: Add comments to workflow instances or tasks
2. **Via Status Changes**: Update status fields to trigger agent actions
3. **Using Command Pages**: Create special command pages in Notion
4. **Through API Endpoints**: Send direct commands via the API (technical users)

## Creating Custom Workflows

The system allows for creating custom workflows that agents will follow:

### Workflow Library Database

This database contains templates for different types of workflows. To create a new workflow template:

1. Add a new entry to the Workflow Library database
2. Define the workflow stages and transitions
3. Specify which agents are involved at each stage
4. Create task templates associated with each stage
5. Define triggers that initiate the workflow
