### **OAuth 2.0 Implementation**

## **WEBHOOK PROCESSING & EVENT HANDLING**

### **Webhook Architecture**

The HigherSelf Network processes GoHighLevel webhooks to maintain real-time synchronization between client subaccounts and our central intelligence hub.

**Webhook Endpoint Configuration**:
```python
# api/routes/gohighlevel_webhooks.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request, HTTPException, Depends
from services.gohighlevel_client_service import GoHighLevelClientService
from services.notion_service import NotionService

router = APIRouter(prefix="/webhooks/gohighlevel", tags=["GoHighLevel Webhooks"])

@router.post("/contact")
async def handle_contact_webhook(
    request: Request,
    ghl_service: GoHighLevelClientService = Depends(),
    notion_service: NotionService = Depends()
):
    """Process contact events from client subaccounts."""

    # Verify webhook signature
    signature = request.headers.get("x-ghl-signature")
    body = await request.body()

    if not ghl_service.verify_webhook_signature(body, signature):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid webhook signature")

    # Parse webhook data
    webhook_data = await request.json()
    event_type = webhook_data.get("type")
    contact_data = webhook_data.get("contact", {})
    location_id = webhook_data.get("locationId")

    # Sync to central Notion hub for analytics
    notion_contact = await notion_service.sync_client_contact({
        "ghl_contact_id": contact_data.get("id"),
        "client_location_id": location_id,
        "contact_data": contact_data,
        "event_type": event_type,
        "timestamp": datetime.now()
    })

    # Trigger multi-agent processing for cross-business opportunities
    if event_type == "contact.created":
        await trigger_lead_analysis_workflow(contact_data, location_id)

    return {"status": "processed", "notion_id": notion_contact.id}

@router.post("/opportunity")
async def handle_opportunity_webhook(
    request: Request,
    ghl_service: GoHighLevelClientService = Depends()
):
    """Process opportunity events from client subaccounts."""

    # Verify webhook signature
    signature = request.headers.get("x-ghl-signature")
    body = await request.body()

    if not ghl_service.verify_webhook_signature(body, signature):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid webhook signature")

    webhook_data = await request.json()
    opportunity_data = webhook_data.get("opportunity", {})

    # Process opportunity stage changes for revenue tracking
    if webhook_data.get("type") == "opportunity.stage_changed":

    """Trigger AI agent analysis for new leads."""

    # Analyze lead potential using Nyra (Lead Capture Specialist)
    lead_analysis = await nyra_agent.analyze_lead_potential({
        "contact_data": contact_data,
        "client_location": client_location_id,
        "source": "client_subaccount"
    })

    # If high-value lead, trigger enhanced nurturing
    if lead_analysis.get("score", 0) >= 80:
        await liora_agent.initiate_high_value_nurture_sequence(contact_data)
```

### **Event Processing Pipeline**

**Webhook Event Router**:
```python

            "created_at": datetime.now()
        })

        # Trigger lead scoring and qualification
        lead_score = await self.calculate_lead_score(contact_data)
