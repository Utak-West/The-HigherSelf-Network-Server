# Solari Booking Manager Roadmap

## Introduction

Solari serves as the Booking & Order Manager within The HigherSelf Network server ecosystem. As the central coordinator for all booking-related activities, Solari plays a critical role in processing orders, managing calendars, handling financial transactions, and orchestrating the logistics required for successful service fulfillment. This document outlines Solari's roles, responsibilities, and workflows, providing a comprehensive blueprint for implementation and operation of this vital component in the agent ecosystem.

Solari's primary purpose is to ensure that every booking and order entering the system receives proper processing, from initial request through payment handling, resource allocation, confirmation, and ultimately to service delivery coordination. By centralizing booking and order management logic, Solari ensures consistent handling procedures, appropriate resource allocation, and seamless integration with fulfillment processes.

## Core Responsibilities and Capabilities

Solari functions as the booking and transaction management center of The HigherSelf Network, with the following core responsibilities:

- **Booking Request Processing**: Receiving and processing booking requests from various channels including website forms, third-party booking platforms, and manual entries
- **Order Management**: Handling the complete order lifecycle from creation through fulfillment and closure
- **Payment Processing**: Managing financial transactions including initial payments, deposits, installments, and refunds
- **Calendar Management**: Maintaining availability calendars for services, resources, and personnel
- **Resource Allocation**: Assigning appropriate resources to fulfill booking requirements
- **Confirmation Management**: Generating and dispatching booking confirmations and receipts to customers
- **Workflow Creation**: Initiating workflow instances for service fulfillment based on booking parameters

Solari's capabilities extend beyond basic booking management to include sophisticated decision-making logic for payment handling, resource optimization, and fulfillment coordination, ensuring that each booking translates effectively into service delivery.

## Booking and Order Processing Workflow

Solari's booking and order processing workflow follows these key steps:

1. **Booking Reception**: Bookings enter the system through one of several channels:
   - Website booking forms and widgets
   - Third-party booking platforms (Amelia, Calendly, etc.)
   - E-commerce systems (WooCommerce, etc.)
   - Manual entries from team members
   - API integrations from partner systems

2. **Initial Validation**: Upon receipt, Solari performs preliminary validation:
   - Verifying the presence of all required booking information
   - Checking for scheduling conflicts and availability
   - Validating customer information completeness
   - Ensuring service/product selection is valid
   - Confirming pricing and discount applicability

3. **Payment Processing**: Solari handles financial aspects of the booking:
   - Processing initial payments or deposits
   - Validating payment method and transaction details
   - Recording financial transactions in accounting systems
   - Calculating commission splits when applicable
   - Generating financial records for reporting

4. **Resource Allocation**: Solari assigns necessary resources:
   - Identifying required service providers or staff members
   - Allocating physical resources or virtual meeting spaces
   - Reserving equipment or materials needed
   - Checking for resource conflicts or limitations

   - Preparing any required intake or preparation materials
   - Customizing confirmation content based on service type
   - Including relevant preparatory instructions

8. **Notification Dispatch**: Solari coordinates communications:
   - Sending confirmation details to the customer
   - Notifying service providers of new bookings
   - Alerting inventory management systems if physical products are involved
   - Informing relevant team members about new bookings
   - Scheduling any required follow-up communications

9. **Post-Booking Management**: Solari handles ongoing booking management:
   - Processing reschedule requests when received
   - Managing cancellation requests including refund processing
   - Handling modifications to existing bookings
   - Sending reminder notifications before appointments

## Conclusion

This Solari Booking Manager roadmap provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing the booking and order management functionality within The HigherSelf Network ecosystem. By following the workflows, decision frameworks, and integration patterns outlined in this document, Solari can effectively manage the complete lifecycle of bookings and orders, from initial request through payment processing, resource allocation, and fulfillment coordination.

The sophisticated decision-making logic for booking approval, resource allocation, and payment processing ensures that each booking is handled appropriately based on its specific requirements and context. Strong integrations with other specialized agents like Ruvo and Sage, as well as with external systems for bookings, e-commerce, payments, and calendaring, position Solari as a central hub for transaction management.

As The HigherSelf Network continues to evolve, this roadmap will serve as a foundation for Solari's implementation and future enhancements, ensuring consistent, reliable booking and order management that supports the overall business ecosystem.

```

This diagram illustrates the comprehensive flow of bookings through Solari's processing system, from initial reception through validation, payment processing, resource allocation, integration with other agents, confirmation, and ongoing booking management.

- Handling time zone considerations
- Generating calendar invitations

- **Microsoft Outlook Integration**: Connection to Outlook calendar systems:
  - Bidirectional calendar synchronization
  - Resource calendar management
  - Meeting request handling
  - Availability publishing

These integrations position Solari as a central hub for booking and order management that connects seamlessly with both internal agents and external systems to create a comprehensive business operations ecosystem.

- **Registration Updates**: As bookings are added to community events, Sage is updated with participant information
- **Capacity Adjustments**: When event capacity changes, coordination ensures proper waitlist management
- **Cancellation Handling**: Collaborative process for managing event cancellations or major changes
- **Member Notifications**: Coordinated approach to member communications about event changes
- **Feedback Collection**: Shared responsibility for gathering and analyzing event feedback

This integration ensures that community events are well-coordinated between booking management and community engagement functions, maintaining consistency in communication and optimal resource utilization.

- **Fulfillment Confirmation**: When all tasks are marked complete, booking status is updated to fulfilled
- **Issue Escalation**: Any issues during fulfillment are reported back for potential booking adjustments

This integration ensures that confirmed bookings are properly fulfilled through appropriate task creation, assignment, and monitoring, maintaining clear visibility into the fulfillment process.
