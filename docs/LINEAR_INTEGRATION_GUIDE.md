## Linear Workflow Best Practices

### Issue Creation Guidelines

#### 1. Writing Effective Issue Titles
```
✅ Good: "Fix Redis connection configuration for production deployment"
❌ Bad: "Redis broken"

✅ Good: "Add authentication middleware to API endpoints"
❌ Bad: "Security stuff"
```

#### 2. Issue Description Template
```markdown
## Problem Description
Brief description of the issue or feature request

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable criteria
- [ ] Clear definition of done
- [ ] Edge cases considered

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation details
- Dependencies
- Performance considerations

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests needed
- Integration tests required
- Manual testing steps
```

#### 3. Proper Labeling Strategy
- **Always use appropriate labels** for categorization
- **Combine labels** when necessary (e.g., Bug + Feature for bug fixes that add functionality)
- **Use priority indicators** through issue ordering and milestones

### Development Workflow Integration

#### 1. Branch Naming Convention
Linear automatically suggests branch names based on issue keys:
```bash
# Linear suggests: THE-123-fix-redis-connection
git checkout -b THE-123-fix-redis-connection
```

#### 2. Commit Message Integration
Reference Linear issues in commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "THE-123: Fix Redis connection configuration

- Update Redis service to use environment variables
- Add connection retry logic
- Implement graceful degradation"
```

#### 3. Automatic Status Updates
Linear automatically updates issue status based on:
- **Branch creation** → Moves to "In Progress"
- **Pull request creation** → Moves to "In Review"
- **Pull request merge** → Moves to "Done"

## Integration with Other Tools

### GitHub Integration

#### Setup
1. Install Linear GitHub app in repository
2. Configure webhook endpoints
3. Set up branch protection rules

#### Features
- **Automatic issue linking** from commit messages
- **Status synchronization** between GitHub PRs and Linear issues
- **Code review integration** with Linear comments

### Notion Integration

#### Data Flow
```
Linear Issues → Notion Database → Agent System Processing
```

#### Synchronization Points
- **Issue creation** triggers Notion database updates
- **Status changes** reflected in Notion workflows
- **Comments and updates** synchronized bidirectionally

### Slack Integration (Optional)

#### Notifications
- Issue assignments
- Status changes
- Milestone completions
- Team mentions

## Project Management Features

### Roadmaps and Planning

#### 1. Milestone Management
- **Create milestones** for major releases
- **Assign issues** to specific milestones
- **Track progress** with visual indicators

#### 2. Sprint Planning
```
1. Create new cycle (sprint)
2. Estimate story points for issues
3. Assign issues to team members
4. Monitor velocity and burndown
```

#### 3. Roadmap Visualization
- **Timeline view** for long-term planning
- **Dependency tracking** between issues
- **Resource allocation** across team members

### Team Collaboration

#### 1. Issue Assignment
- **Auto-assignment** based on code ownership
- **Load balancing** across team members
- **Skill-based assignment** for specialized tasks

#### 2. Communication
- **Contextual comments** on specific issues
- **@mentions** for team coordination

## Advanced Linear Features

### Custom Views and Filters

#### 1. Personal Dashboard
```
Filter: Assignee = Me AND Status != Done
Sort: Priority DESC, Updated DESC
```

#### 2. Team Sprint View
```
Filter: Cycle = Current AND Team = THE
Group by: Status
Sort: Priority DESC
```

#### 3. Bug Triage View
```
Filter: Label = Bug AND Status = Backlog
Sort: Created ASC
```

### Automation Rules

#### 1. Auto-labeling
- **Bug reports** automatically get "Bug" label
- **Feature requests** get "Feature" label
- **Security issues** get high priority

#### 2. Status Transitions
- **Stale issues** automatically move to backlog
- **Completed PRs** trigger issue completion
- **Failed builds** reopen related issues

## Metrics and Reporting

    labels=["Bug", "Critical"],
    assignee="system-admin"
)
```

#### 2. Status Synchronization
- **Notion workflows** trigger Linear updates
