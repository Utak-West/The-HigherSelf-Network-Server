### ü§ù Universal Participation
- Individual practitioners and business entities can participate
- Integration with existing user profiles and business entity data
- Flexible service offering and requesting capabilities

### üîç Smart Matching
- Compatibility scoring algorithm
- Cultural relevance assessment
- Value balance calculations
- Distance and availability matching

## System Architecture

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Listing
```python
listing = BarterListing(
    provider_id="wellness_center_123",
    provider_type="business",
    title="Holistic Wellness Consultation",
    description="Comprehensive wellness assessment and guidance",
    category=ServiceCategory.WELLNESS_CONSULTATION,
    skill_level=SkillLevel.EXPERT,
    location=Location(
        city="San Francisco",
        country="United States",
        cultural_region=CulturalRegion.NORTH_AMERICA,
        latitude=37.7749,
        longitude=-122.4194
    ),
    available_hours_per_week=20,
    base_value_per_hour=150
)
```

### Searching for Services
```python
# Search for yoga instruction within 25km of location
results = await barter_service.search_listings(
    location=user_location,
    radius_km=25,
    category=ServiceCategory.YOGA_INSTRUCTION,
    limit=10
)
```

### Finding Matches
```python
# Find matches for a barter request
matches = await barter_service.find_matches(
    request=barter_request,
    limit=5
)
```
