# The HigherSelf Network Server: Automation Flows

This document provides detailed information about the automation flows implemented in The HigherSelf Network Server based on the 16-database Notion structure. Each flow represents an end-to-end business process that is automated through the system.

## Overview

The HigherSelf Network Server implements eight core automation flows that cover the essential business operations for The Connection Practice and The 7 Space. All flows use Notion as the central data hub, ensuring data consistency and process integrity.

## Automation Flow Map

### Flow 1: Lead Capture & Initial Processing (Multi-Source)

## Implementation Details

All automation flows are implemented using a combination of:

1. **Webhook Handlers**: Receive data from external systems
2. **Specialized Agents**: Process domain-specific logic
3. **Notion Database Operations**: Store and retrieve data from the 16-database structure
4. **Task Creation**: Generate actionable tasks for both automated and human steps
5. **Notification System**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout processes

## Testing Flows

The system includes a testing utility (`tools/test_automation_flows.py`) that allows for testing each flow with mock data. This can be used to verify flow functionality without making actual API calls by using the system's test mode.

To test a specific flow:

```bash
./tools/test_automation_flows.py --flow "Flow 1: Lead Capture & Initial Processing"
```

To test all flows:

```bash
./tools/test_automation_flows.py
```

## Extending Flows

To add new capabilities to existing flows or create new flows:

1. Identify which agents need to be modified or created
2. Update the relevant webhook handlers if new external triggers are needed
3. Extend the Notion database models if new data structures are required
4. Implement the new logic in the appropriate agent methods
5. Update the automation flow mapping in `config/notion_databases.py`
6. Add test cases to the automation flow testing utility
