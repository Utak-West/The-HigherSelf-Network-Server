## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Multi-Environment Strategy

#### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Configuration**: `terragrunt/environments/development/`
- **Resources**: Minimal resource allocation (1 replica, 10Gi storage)
- **Security**: Less restrictive for testing (0.0.0.0/0 CIDR)

#### Staging Environment  
- **Purpose**: Production-like testing and validation
- **Configuration**: `terragrunt/environments/staging/`
- **Resources**: Production-like but smaller (2-4 replicas, 50Gi storage)
- **Security**: Moderate restrictions (internal networks only)

#### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live The 7 Space operations
- **Configuration**: `terragrunt/environments/production/`
- **Resources**: Full scaling (3-10 replicas, 100Gi+ storage)
- **Security**: Highly restrictive with specific IP ranges

### 2. Container Orchestration Strategy

#### Core Services Stack
```yaml
services:
  - higherself-server: Main application with The 7 Space entity focus
  - mongodb: Contact and workflow data storage
  - redis: Caching and session management
  - nginx: Load balancing and SSL termination
  - prometheus: Metrics collection
  - grafana: Monitoring dashboards
  - consul: Service discovery and configuration
```

### Multi-Entity Architecture Integration

#### Business Entity Priority Order
1. **AM Consulting**: 1,300 contacts (highest priority)
2. **The 7 Space**: 191 contacts (focused deployment)
3. **HigherSelf Core**: 1,300 contacts (community platform)

#### Entity Isolation Strategy
- **Database Separation**: Isolated contact databases per entity
- **Workflow Segregation**: Entity-specific automation sequences
- **Resource Allocation**: Proportional resource distribution
- **Access Control**: Role-based access per business entity

## Deployment Automation Strategy

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terragrunt)

#### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Initialize environment
./terragrunt-deploy.sh init production

# Plan deployment
./terragrunt-deploy.sh plan production
