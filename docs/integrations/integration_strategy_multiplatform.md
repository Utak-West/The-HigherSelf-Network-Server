# Integrating Zapier, N8N, & Make with The HigherSelf Network Server

## I. Introduction & Overarching Strategy

**Goal:** Enhance your existing Python/Notion-based workflows by:
1.  Adding more complex AI-driven decision-making.
2.  Integrating new third-party tools not currently supported by your Python agents.

**Core Principle:** Use Zapier, N8N, and Make as "intelligent connective tissue." They can handle triggers from various services, orchestrate steps involving multiple apps (including your own via API calls), and implement AI logic visually. Your existing Python agents (e.g., `LeadCaptureAgent`, `BookingAgent`) and the "Grace Fields" orchestrator (conceptualized in `AGENTS.MD`) remain crucial for complex business logic and deep Notion interactions. Notion will always be the central source of truth.

**General Interaction Model:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Source/App] -- Trigger --> B{Automation Platform (Zapier/N8N/Make)};
    B -- API Call --> C[HigherSelf Server API (/webhooks/... or /api/...)];
    C -- Event --> D[Grace Fields Orchestrator];
    D -- Routes to --> E[Specific Python Agent (e.g., Nyra, Solari)];
    E -- Interacts with --> F[Notion Databases];
    E -- Optionally calls back --> B_WH[Automation Platform Webhook for further steps];
    F -- Data Updates --> E;
```

## II. General Best Practices for Integration

1.  **API-First Approach:**
    *   Leverage your existing FastAPI endpoints (e.g., `/webhooks/typeform`, `/api/forms/submit`).
    *   Be prepared to create new, dedicated endpoints on your HigherSelf Server for tailored interactions.
2.  **Clear Demarcation of Responsibilities:**
    *   **Automation Platforms:** Triggers, simple/moderate data transformations, visual flow control, API calls to HigherSelf, built-in AI steps.
    *   **HigherSelf Python Agents:** Complex domain-specific logic, deep Notion interactions, custom Python/AI code.
3.  **Notion as the Single Source of Truth:** All critical data resides in or is synchronized to Notion.
4.  **Idempotency and Error Handling:** Design robust API endpoints and platform flows.
5.  **Security:** Use unique API keys/secrets, validate webhook signatures.
6.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Utilize platform features and ensure comprehensive server-side logging.
7.  **Modularity:** Design reusable flows/components within platforms.

## III. Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Pilot Project - Zapier for New Event Management Platform Integration

*   **Platform:** Zapier
*   **Specific Goal:** Integrate a new event management platform (e.g., Eventbrite) to capture new event registrations, processing them as leads via your `LeadCaptureAgent`.
*   **Steps in Zapier (The "Zap"):**
    1.  **Trigger:** "New Attendee Registered" in your chosen event platform.
    2.  **Action (Optional):** "Filter by Zapier" for specific events.
    3.  **Action:** "Formatter by Zapier" for data standardization.
    4.  **Action (Optional AI Enhancement):** Use Zapier's "OpenAI" or "Anthropic" action for simple AI tasks (e.g., categorizing interest).
    5.  **Action:** "Webhooks by Zapier (POST)" to a HigherSelf Server endpoint (e.g., `/api/integrations/event_registration`).
*   **On the HigherSelf Server Side:**
    *   The new endpoint receives Zapier data.
    *   It invokes the `LeadCaptureAgent` for Notion processing.
*   **Mermaid Diagram:**
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Event Platform: New Attendee] --> B{Zapier Zap};
        B -- Filter (Optional) --> B_Filter[Filter Data];
        B_Filter -- Formatter --> B_Format[Format Data];
        B_Format -- AI Enhancement (Optional) --> B_AI[Categorize Interest];
        B_AI -- POST Request --> C[HigherSelf API: /api/integrations/event_registration];
        C -- Invoke --> D[LeadCaptureAgent];
        D -- Interacts with --> E[Notion Databases];
    ```

### Phase 2: Expansion with Advanced AI & Workflow Orchestration (N8N Focus)

*   **Goal:** Implement more sophisticated AI decision-making and complex workflows.
*   **Platform Example:** N8N
*   **Use Case Example: AI-Powered Lead Enrichment & Personalized Outreach**
    *   **Trigger:** HigherSelf Agent POSTs to N8N Webhook after initial lead processing.
    *   **N8N Flow:**
        1.  Enrich lead data (e.g., Clearbit).
        2.  Use LLM node (OpenAI/Anthropic) to qualify lead, generate rationale, and suggest personalized outreach lines.
        3.  Update Notion Contact page and/or create a task in `Master Tasks DB` via HigherSelf API or direct Notion node.
    *   **Mermaid Diagram:**
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            N8N_A[HigherSelf Agent POSTs to N8N Webhook] --> N8N_B{N8N Workflow};
            N8N_B -- Enrich (Clearbit) --> N8N_C[Enriched Data];
            N8N_C -- LLM (OpenAI) --> N8N_D[Qualification & Outreach Suggestions];
            N8N_D -- POST Request --> N8N_E[HigherSelf API: /api/leads/update_enriched_data];
            N8N_E --> N8N_F[Update Notion & Create Task];
        ```

### Phase 3: Broader Integration & Optimization (Make Focus & Standardization)

*   **Goal:** Integrate more services, tackle data-intensive tasks, and standardize decision-making for platform choice.
*   **Platform Example:** Make (formerly Integromat)
*   **Use Case Example: Automated Content Topic Suggestion Based on Trending News**
    *   **Trigger:** Scheduled daily.
    *   **Make Flow:**
        1.  Fetch news from various RSS feeds/APIs.
        2.  Use LLM node to analyze news, identify trends, and suggest blog post topics with relevance.
        3.  Create content ideas in Notion via HigherSelf API.
    *   **Mermaid Diagram:**
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            Make_A[Schedule: Daily] --> Make_B{Make Scenario};
            Make_B -- Fetch News (RSS/HTTP) --> Make_C[Aggregate News Items];
            Make_C -- LLM (OpenAI) --> Make_D[Identify Trends & Suggest Topics];
            Make_D -- Iterate & POST --> Make_E[HigherSelf API: /api/content/suggest_topic];
            Make_E --> Make_F[Create Content Idea in Notion];
        ```
*   **Develop:** A clear decision-making framework/playbook for your team on when to use Zapier, N8N, Make, or custom Python agents.
*   **Establish:** Robust monitoring, logging, and maintenance procedures.

## IV. Platform-Specific Strengths (Recap for Playbook)

*   **Zapier:**
    *   **Strengths:** Simplicity, vast number of app connectors, good for linear workflows.
    *   **Best Fit for HigherSelf:** Quick connections for new third-party services, simple lead routing.
*   **N8N:**
    *   **Strengths:** Powerful visual workflow builder, complex logic, custom code nodes (JS/Python), AI nodes, self-hostable.
    *   **Best Fit for HigherSelf:** Sophisticated AI decision-making, custom logic snippets within flows, complex API integrations.
*   **Make (formerly Integromat):**
    *   **Strengths:** Intuitive visual interface, complex data mapping, advanced scheduling, robust error handling.
    *   **Best Fit for HigherSelf:** Workflows with intricate data manipulations, sophisticated scheduling, visual clarity for complex data flows.

## V. Implementing Complex AI Decision-Making (Advanced Notes)

*   N8N & Make are well-suited for visually building multi-step AI agentic flows using their LLM, Tool (HTTP), and Control Flow nodes.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** For very advanced AI (custom models, complex LangChain/LlamaIndex chains):
    1.  Use N8N/Make for visual orchestration and external service connections.
    2.  For complex AI tasks, call a dedicated HigherSelf Server endpoint.
    3.  This endpoint triggers specialized Python code/agents for heavy AI lifting.

## VI. Integrating New Third-Party Tools (General Checklist)

1.  **Check Native Connectors:** In Zapier/N8N/Make.
2.  **API Integration:** Use HTTP request modules if the tool has an API.
3.  **Webhook Integration (Incoming):** If the tool can send webhooks, set up triggers in the platforms or on your HigherSelf Server.
4.  **Data Mapping:** Crucial for ensuring data consistency with your Notion structure.

This strategy provides a roadmap for progressively enhancing your automation capabilities, starting with a practical Zapier integration and scaling towards more complex, AI-driven workflows using N8N and Make, all while leveraging your robust Python and Notion foundation.
