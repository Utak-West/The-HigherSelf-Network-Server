# WordPress-Higher Self Network Integration Strategy

## For The 7 Space Art Gallery & Wellness Center

## Executive Summary

This integration strategy document outlines the comprehensive approach to connecting The 7 Space's WordPress-based website with The Higher Self Network server. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, this solution bridges WordPress plugins with Higher Self Network's intelligent agent system to create a seamless experience across both platforms.

The 7 Space, as both an art gallery and wellness center, requires a specialized integration that supports its dual business nature. This document provides a detailed roadmap for:

1. Aligning WordPress plugin functionality with Higher Self Network capabilities
2. Supporting art gallery-specific operations (exhibitions, artist management, artwork sales)
3. Enabling wellness center services (practitioner scheduling, treatment bookings, wellness programs)
4. Creating targeted client/community portals for different user types
5. Optimizing the current plugin architecture (14 active, 111 inactive plugins)

This integration will deliver substantial benefits including:

- Centralized data management in Notion
- Automated workflow orchestration through intelligent agents
- Personalized client experiences via customized Softr portals
- Reduced technical complexity and maintenance overhead
- Enhanced marketing and business intelligence capabilities

The implementation will follow a phased approach prioritized by business impact, with initial focus on core content synchronization and booking capabilities, followed by e-commerce integration, and culminating in advanced portal experiences for clients and staff.
