# Agent-Augmented Git Conflict Resolution

## Overview

This system leverages your Windsurf IDE's Agent Augmentation capabilities to systematically resolve git merge conflicts using multi-agent coordination patterns. It's specifically designed to handle your 100+ conflicting files while preserving critical CI fixes from PR #4.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/repos/The-HigherSelf-Network-Server
python scripts/agent_git_resolver.py
```

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination System

The system uses 5 specialized agents working together:

- **ContextAnalyzer**: Analyzes git status and identifies conflict patterns
- **ConflictCoordinator**: Manages backup creation and merge operations
- **FileClassifier**: Categorizes conflicts by type and priority
- **ConflictResolver**: Applies resolution strategies based on file categories
- **ValidationAgent**: Verifies critical functionality after resolution

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

#### High Priority (Preserve PR #4 Changes)
- `config/settings.py` - Pydantic V2 migration fixes
- `requirements.txt` - python-dotenv version update
- `.github/workflows/enhanced-cicd.yml` - CI environment variables

#### Medium Priority (Intelligent Merge)
- `agents/*.py`, `services/*.py` - Local agent development work
- `api/*.py` - Local API development work

#### Low Priority (Preserve Local)
- `test*.py`, `tests/*.py` - Local testing and debugging files

### Safety Features

- **Automatic Backup**: Creates timestamped stash and patch file before any changes
- **Error Recovery**: 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Rollback Capability**: Can restore from backup if resolution fails
- **Validation Checks**: Verifies settings import, Redis service, and Pydantic warnings

## Expected Output

## What Gets Preserved

After successful resolution, you'll have:

- ✅ **Pydantic V2 Migration**: All 113+ deprecation warnings eliminated
- ✅ **Environment Variable Loading**: Settings load properly with case_sensitive=False
- ✅ **Dependency Fixes**: python-dotenv>=1.0.1 resolves version conflicts
- ✅ **CI Configuration**: TESTING_MODE, NOTION_API_TOKEN environment variables
- ✅ **Redis Optimization**: Environment variable caching from original PR #3
- ✅ **Local Development Work**: Your agent implementations and API changes preserved

## Troubleshooting

### If Resolution Fails

The system includes automatic error recovery, but if manual intervention is needed:

1. **Check the backup**: Your work is saved in the timestamped stash and patch file
2. **Review conflict categories**: The system will show which files couldn't be resolved
3. **Manual resolution**: Use standard git conflict resolution for remaining files
4. **Restore from backup**: `git stash pop` to restore your original state

### If Validation Fails

If any validation check fails after resolution:

1. **Settings Import Error**: Check config/settings.py for syntax issues
2. **Redis Service Error**: Verify Redis service configuration is intact
3. **Pydantic Warnings**: Check for remaining deprecated Field patterns

### Emergency Rollback

If you need to completely rollback:

```bash
# Find your backup stash
git stash list

# Restore from stash (replace N with stash number)
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Undo merge commit
git stash apply stash@{N}  # Restore your changes

# Or restore from patch file
git apply /tmp/git_conflict_backup_TIMESTAMP.patch
```

## Configuration Files

- `.windsurf/git_conflict_resolution.json` - Agent coordination configuration
- `.windsurf/agent_augmentation.json` - Base agent augmentation settings
- `scripts/agent_git_resolver.py` - Executable workflow script

## Next Steps After Resolution

1. **Run Your Tests**: Verify functionality with your existing test suite
2. **Check CI Status**: The fixes should resolve your CI pipeline issues
3. **Continue Development**: Your local work is preserved and ready to continue
4. **Deploy with Confidence**: All optimizations and fixes are now active

The agent augmentation system ensures you get the best of both worlds - the critical CI fixes from PR #4 and your valuable local development work, all resolved systematically and safely.
