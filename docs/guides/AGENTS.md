**Responsibilities:**

## Implementation

Each agent is implemented as a Python class that extends the BaseAgent class, with the agent's name and personality informing its approach to its specialized tasks. All agents coordinate through Notion as the central hub, maintaining consistency while bringing their unique personalities to their respective domains.

```python
# Example implementation structure
class GraceOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, agents: list):
        self.agents = {agent.name: agent for agent in agents}

    def route_event(self, event_type):
        # Route to appropriate agent based on event type
        if event_type == "new_lead":
            self.agents["Nyra"].run()
        elif event_type == "booking_created":
            self.agents["Solari"].run()
        # ... and so on
```

This agent personality system brings both structure and character to The HigherSelf Network Server, making the automation system more intuitive and engaging for both administrators and users.
