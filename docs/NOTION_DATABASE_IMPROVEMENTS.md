## Next Steps

To fully leverage these improvements:

1. **Create Automation Scripts**: Develop Python scripts using the Notion API to:
   - Update the "Last Transition Date" and "Time in Current State" fields automatically
   - Validate data against referenced Pydantic models
   - Generate audit trail entries for database operations

2. **Configure Webhook Security**: Implement the webhook authentication methods specified in the API Integrations Catalog

3. **Set Up Health Monitoring**: Configure automated checks to update agent health status

4. **Document Relationships**: Update workflow documentation to reflect the new database relationships

All improvements have been implemented following the server rules established in `.windsurf/rules/server-rules.md` and support the operational workflows documented for The 7 Space and other business entities.
