# Contributing to The HigherSelf Network Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The HigherSelf Network Server project. This document provides comprehensive guidelines and instructions for contributing to this innovative AI-powered automation platform.

## Project Vision

The HigherSelf Network Server represents the intersection of cutting-edge technology and human-centered design, creating intelligent automation for art galleries, wellness centers, and consultancy businesses. Our mission is to enhance human potential through thoughtful technology that preserves the personal touch while streamlining operations.

## Core Principles

All contributions must adhere to the following foundational principles:

### 1. Notion as Central Hub
Notion serves as the central data and workflow management hub for all operations. This architectural decision ensures:
- **Unified Data Model**: All business data flows through Notion's structured databases
- **User Familiarity**: Teams already know and love Notion
- **Visual Workflow Tracking**: Clear visibility into all processes
- **Collaborative Management**: Team-friendly interface for all stakeholders

**Requirement**: Any changes must maintain and enhance this Notion-centric architecture.

### 2. Pydantic AI Framework Compliance
All data models and Notion interactions must strictly adhere to the Pydantic AI framework:
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints and validation
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic validation of all data structures
- **API Consistency**: Standardized request/response patterns
- **Error Prevention**: Catch data issues before they propagate

**Requirement**: Use Pydantic models for all data structures and API interactions.

### 3. Agent-Centric Design
The system is built around named agent personalities with distinct characteristics:
- **Human-Like Interaction**: Agents have personalities and specializations
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents work together on complex workflows
- **Graceful Orchestration**: Grace Fields coordinates all agent activities
- **Extensible Framework**: New agents can be added following established patterns

**Requirement**: Maintain agent personality consistency and collaborative patterns.

### 4. Modularity and Idempotency
Design for reliability and maintainability:
- **Modular Components**: Each component should be independently testable
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry operations without side effects
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined boundaries between components

### 5. Security-First Approach
Implement comprehensive security measures:
- **Credential Management**: Secure handling of API tokens and secrets
- **Authentication**: Robust API key and webhook validation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and secure transmission
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

### 6. Comprehensive Observability
Maintain complete system visibility:
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent, searchable log formats
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system health indicators
- **Performance Tracking**: Response times and resource utilization
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error capture and analysis

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # if exists
   ```

5. Set up pre-commit hooks (if configured):

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code style

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, ensuring you follow the coding standards

3. Add tests for your changes

4. Update documentation as needed

5. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature X to solve problem Y"
   ```

6. Push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Open a pull request against the `main` branch

## Important Guidelines
