### **CODEBASE ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING**

#### **Core Service Pattern** (`services/base_service.py`)
```python
class BaseService:
    """All services inherit from this base class providing:
    - Async HTTP methods with retry logic
    - Credential management and validation
    - Health monitoring and error tracking
    - Webhook signature verification
    - Connection pooling with aiohttp
    """
```

**Key Methods AI Assistants Must Understand**:
- `async_get()`, `async_post()`, `async_put()`, `async_delete()`
- `validate_credentials()`
- `verify_webhook_signature()`
- `get_health_status()`

#### **Integration Manager Pattern** (`services/integration_manager.py`)
```python
class IntegrationManager:
    """Centralized service lifecycle management:
    - Service registration and initialization
    - Health monitoring across all services
    - Bidirectional sync coordination with Notion
    - Error aggregation and reporting
    """
```

#### **AI Agent Architecture** (`agents/agent_personalities.py`)
```python
class BaseAgent:
    """All AI agents inherit providing:
    - Notion service integration
    - Event processing capabilities
    - Cross-agent communication
    - Workflow orchestration
    """
```

### **IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS**

#### **Code Quality Requirements**
1. **Type Hints**: All functions must include complete type annotations
2. **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all classes and methods
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with specific exception types
4. **Logging**: Structured logging using loguru with appropriate levels
5. **Async/Await**: Proper async implementation for all I/O operations

#### **Naming Conventions**
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`GoHighLevelService`)
- **Functions/Methods**: snake_case (`create_contact`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`GOHIGHLEVEL_API_BASE_URL`)
- **Files**: snake_case (`gohighlevel_service.py`)
