# HigherSelf Network Server - Gruntwork Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration of Gruntwork's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools and services into the HigherSelf Network Server project, following enterprise-grade best practices and addressing the identified "Potential Gotchas."

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

### ‚úÖ Implemented Components

1. **Terragrunt Integration**
   - Root `terragrunt.hcl` configuration with remote state management
   - Environment-specific configurations (development, staging, production)
   - Automated S3 backend with DynamoDB locking
   - Provider generation and common variable inheritance

2. **Secrets Management Module**
   - AWS Secrets Manager integration following Gruntwork patterns
   - KMS encryption for all secrets
   - Automated password generation for database credentials
   - IAM roles and policies for secure access
   - Support for secret rotation

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - Enhanced `terragrunt-deploy.sh` script with safety checks
   - Environment validation and prerequisite checking
   - Production deployment safeguards
   - Module-specific deployment capabilities

### ‚úÖ Risk Mitigation Implemented

- **Name Changes During Refactoring**: Structured naming conventions prevent conflicts
- **Sensitive Data in State**: S3 backend with encryption and DynamoDB locking
- **Cloud Timeouts**: Built-in retry logic and timeout handling
- **Naming Conflicts**: Hierarchical naming structure with environment prefixes
- **Configuration Consistency**: Enforced through Terragrunt patterns and validation

## Phase 2: IaC Library Integration (PLANNED)

### üéØ Objectives

1. **Replace Custom Modules with Gruntwork IaC Library**
2. **Implement Enterprise-Grade Networking**
3. **Enhance Security and Compliance**
4. **Improve Monitoring and Observability**

### üìã Migration Plan

#### 2.1 Networking Infrastructure

**Current State**: Basic Docker networking

```hcl
# Replace current Docker network with:
module "vpc" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 0.21"
  
  vpc_name   = "higherself-network-${var.environment}"
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr_block
  
  num_availability_zones = 3
  public_subnet_bits     = 8
  private_subnet_bits    = 8
}

module "alb" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/load-balancer/aws//modules/alb"
  version = "~> 0.29"
  
  alb_name = "higherself-alb-${var.environment}"
  vpc_id   = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.public_subnet_ids
}
```

#### 2.2 Database Infrastructure

**Current State**: Docker MongoDB and Redis containers
**Target State**: AWS managed services with Gruntwork modules

```hcl
# Replace MongoDB container with DocumentDB
module "documentdb" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/data-storage/aws//modules/documentdb"
  version = "~> 0.23"
  
  cluster_name = "higherself-docdb-${var.environment}"
  vpc_id       = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids   = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}

# Replace Redis container with ElastiCache
module "redis" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/cache/aws//modules/redis"
  version = "~> 0.19"
  
  name       = "higherself-redis-${var.environment}"
  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}
```

#### 2.3 Application Infrastructure

**Current State**: Docker containers on single host
**Target State**: ECS with Gruntwork modules

```hcl
module "ecs_cluster" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/ecs/aws//modules/ecs-cluster"
  version = "~> 0.35"
  
  cluster_name = "higherself-cluster-${var.environment}"
  vpc_id       = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids   = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}

module "ecs_service" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/ecs/aws//modules/ecs-service"
  version = "~> 0.35"
  
  service_name = "higherself-app-${var.environment}"
  ecs_cluster_arn = module.ecs_cluster.ecs_cluster_arn
  
  # Container definitions with secrets integration
  container_definitions = [
    {
      name  = "higherself-app"
      image = "thehigherselfnetworkserver:latest"
      secrets = [
        {
          name      = "NOTION_API_TOKEN"
          valueFrom = module.secrets.secrets_arns["notion_api_token"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2.4 Monitoring and Observability

**Current State**: Basic Prometheus and Grafana containers
**Target State**: AWS CloudWatch with Gruntwork monitoring modules

```hcl
module "cloudwatch_dashboard" {
  source = "gruntwork-io/monitoring/aws//modules/cloudwatch-dashboard"
  version = "~> 0.36"
  
  dashboard_name = "HigherSelf-Network-${var.environment}"
  
  # Custom metrics for our application
  widgets = [
    {
      type = "metric"
      properties = {
        metrics = [
          ["AWS/ECS", "CPUUtilization", "ServiceName", module.ecs_service.service_name],
          ["AWS/ECS", "MemoryUtilization", "ServiceName", module.ecs_service.service_name]
        ]
      }
    }
