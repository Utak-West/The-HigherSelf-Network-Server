### **COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS**

#### **Daily Standup Format**
Each AI assistant should provide:
1. **Completed**: What was finished since last update
2. **In Progress**: Current work items
3. **Blockers**: Dependencies or issues
4. **Next**: Planned work for next period

#### **Component Interface Documentation**
When creating or modifying components, document:
```python
"""
Component: [Component Name]
Owner: [Primary AI Assistant]
Dependencies: [List of required components]
Provides: [List of public methods/classes]
Last Updated: [Date]
Status: [In Progress/Complete/Needs Review]

Public Interface:
- method_name(params) -> return_type: Description
- class_name: Description of class purpose

Dependencies Required:
- component_name.method_name: How it's used
- external_library: Purpose

Notes:
- Any special considerations
- Known limitations
- Future enhancements planned
"""
```

#### **Issue Escalation Process**
1. **Level 1**: Try to resolve within component
2. **Level 2**: Consult with component dependencies
3. **Level 3**: Escalate to all AI assistants
4. **Level 4**: Request human intervention

---

### **CODE INTEGRATION STANDARDS**

#### **Git Workflow Simulation**
Since AI assistants can't use Git directly, simulate branching:
```
Main Branch: Complete, tested code
Feature Branches: Work in progress by each AI
- feature/manus-core-service
- feature/jules-business-logic
- feature/api-specialist-endpoints
- feature/data-specialist-models
```

#### **Code Review Process**
1. **Self Review**: AI assistant reviews own code
2. **Peer Review**: Related component owners review
3. **Integration Review**: All assistants validate interfaces
4. **Final Review**: Complete system validation

#### **Merge Criteria**
Code must meet all criteria before integration:
- [ ] Follows established patterns from existing codebase
- [ ] Includes comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Has appropriate logging statements
- [ ] Includes type hints and docstrings
- [ ] Passes all validation checks
- [ ] Integrates properly with dependent components

---

### **TESTING COORDINATION**

#### **Test Ownership**
```python
# Unit Tests - Component Owner Responsibility
test_gohighlevel_service.py      # Manus AI
test_gohighlevel_business.py     # Jules AI
test_gohighlevel_models.py       # Data Specialist
test_gohighlevel_api.py          # API Specialist

# Integration Tests - Testing Specialist
test_gohighlevel_integration.py  # Cross-component testing
test_gohighlevel_workflows.py    # End-to-end workflows
test_gohighlevel_performance.py  # Performance validation
```

#### **Test Data Management**
Shared test data for consistency:
```python
# Shared test fixtures
SAMPLE_CONTACTS = {
    "art_gallery_client": {...},
    "wellness_center_member": {...},
    "consultancy_client": {...},
    "executive_coaching_client": {...}
}

SAMPLE_OPPORTUNITIES = {
    "art_purchase": {...},
    "wellness_program": {...},
    "consulting_project": {...}
}
```

### **CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

#### **Code Conflicts**
When multiple AI assistants modify related code:
1. **Identify Conflict**: Document what conflicts exist
2. **Analyze Impact**: Determine which approach is better
3. **Merge Strategy**: Combine best elements from both
4. **Validate**: Ensure merged solution works correctly

#### **Design Disagreements**
When AI assistants have different implementation approaches:
1. **Document Options**: Each AI explains their approach
2. **Evaluate Criteria**: Performance, maintainability, scalability
3. **Existing Patterns**: Prefer approaches that match codebase
4. **Consensus**: Agree on unified approach

#### **Resource Conflicts**
When multiple AI assistants need the same resources:
1. **Priority Matrix**: Critical path items get priority
2. **Time Boxing**: Allocate specific time slots
3. **Parallel Work**: Find ways to work simultaneously
4. **Communication**: Keep others informed of resource usage
