# 📝 Notion Database Mapping Scripts 🌐

This directory contains mapping scripts for all 16 databases in The HigherSelf Network system. These scripts are designed to be used with Notion AI to implement the required automations and ensure proper database structure.

## 🛠️ How to Use These Scripts

1. Open each database in Notion
2. Open the corresponding mapping script
3. Use Notion AI to implement the changes described in the script
4. Verify that all properties, automations, and views have been created correctly

## 🏢 Core Operational Databases

2. [👥 Contacts & Profiles](02_contacts_profiles.md) - Customer and contact information
3. [🌍 Community Hub](03_community_hub.md) - Community member data
4. [🛍️ Products & Services](04_products_services.md) - Product and service catalog
5. [⚙️ Workflow Instances](05_workflow_instances.md) - Active workflow instances
6. [📣 Marketing Campaigns](06_marketing_campaigns.md) - Marketing campaign data
7. [📊 Feedback & Surveys](07_feedback_surveys.md) - Customer feedback and survey responses
8. [🏆 Rewards & Bounties](08_rewards_bounties.md) - Reward and bounty programs
9. [✅ Master Tasks Database](09_master_tasks.md) - Centralized task management

## 🤖 Agent & System Support Databases

10. [🔄 Agent Communication Patterns](10_agent_communication_patterns.md) - Communication patterns between agents
11. [🤖 Agent Registry](11_agent_registry.md) - Registry of all agents in the system
12. [🔌 API Integrations Catalog](12_api_integrations_catalog.md) - Catalog of API integrations
13. [🔄 Data Transformations Registry](13_data_transformations_registry.md) - Registry of data transformation rules
14. [📨 Notifications Templates](14_notifications_templates.md) - Templates for notifications
15. [📋 Use Cases Library](15_use_cases_library.md) - Library of use cases
16. [📝 Workflows Library](16_workflows_library.md) - Library of workflow definitions

## 📋 Implementation Order

For best results, implement the databases in the following order:

1. 🏛️ Business Entities Registry
2. 🤖 Agent Registry
3. 🔌 API Integrations Catalog
4. 📝 Workflows Library
5. 👥 Contacts & Profiles
6. 🛍️ Products & Services
7. 🔄 Data Transformations Registry
8. 🔄 Agent Communication Patterns
9. 📋 Use Cases Library
10. 📨 Notifications Templates
11. ⚙️ Workflow Instances
12. ✅ Master Tasks Database
13. 🌍 Community Hub
14. 📣 Marketing Campaigns
15. 📊 Feedback & Surveys
16. 🏆 Rewards & Bounties

This order ensures that relation properties can be properly connected as you build out the system.

## 📑 Common Elements

Each mapping script includes:

- **📝 Database Overview**: Brief description of the database's purpose
- **🔧 Required Properties**: All properties that should be added to the database
- **⚙️ Automation Setup**: Automations to implement for this database
- **👁️ Views to Create**: Recommended views for organizing the data
- **🧪 Sample Data**: Example records to add for testing
- **🔗 Relationships with Other Databases**: How this database connects to others
- **🔄 Sync Configuration**: Formulas to help with synchronization

## 🤖 Notion AI Instructions

When using Notion AI to implement these scripts, try the following prompts:

1. "Help me set up the properties for this database according to the mapping script"
2. "Create the automations described in the mapping script"
3. "Set up the recommended views for this database"
4. "Add the sample data records to this database"

## 🔄 Synchronization with Supabase

Each database includes properties for Supabase synchronization:

- **🆔 Supabase ID**: Stores the corresponding ID in Supabase
- **⏱️ Last Synced**: Timestamp of the last synchronization
- **🔍 Needs Sync**: Formula to identify records that need synchronization

These properties enable the bidirectional sync between Notion and Supabase.
