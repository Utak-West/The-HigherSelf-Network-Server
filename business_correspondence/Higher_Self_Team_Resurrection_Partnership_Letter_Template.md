**RE: Partnership Documentation - Capacity Building Support for Grant Application**

Dear Malika McCall and Team Resurrection Leadership,

Higher Self is pleased to provide this formal documentation of our established partnership with Team Resurrection Inc. to support your current grant application. As a nonprofit organization specializing in capacity building and partnership facilitation, we have worked closely with Team Resurrection over the past several years to strengthen organizational systems and enhance community service delivery in Newark's Central Ward and West Ward communities.

Our partnership has focused primarily on building Team Resurrection's operational capacity through comprehensive organizational development support. Higher Self has provided strategic planning assistance, program development guidance, and administrative systems strengthening to enhance your organization's ability to deliver effective youth services and community programming. Through our capacity-building approach, we have supported Team Resurrection in developing sustainable operational frameworks that maximize community impact.

## New Pathways Program Success and Office of Violence Prevention Collaboration

Higher Self provided comprehensive capacity-building support that directly contributed to Team Resurrection's successful implementation of the New Pathways program, demonstrating our organization's commitment to evidence-based violence prevention and youth development initiatives. Our collaboration has been particularly effective in supporting Team Resurrection's work with the Office of Violence Prevention, where our combined expertise has strengthened community-based intervention strategies and enhanced service delivery to at-risk youth populations.

The collaborative youth services programming developed through our partnership has demonstrated measurable community outcomes. Together, we have implemented mentorship programs serving 150+ youth annually, established community engagement initiatives in targeted neighborhoods, and developed evidence-based intervention strategies. Our joint efforts have focused on underserved youth in the Central Ward and West Ward, families affected by justice system involvement, and young adults transitioning to independence.

Higher Self has provided direct capacity-building support in several key areas essential to successful grant management and program implementation:

**Organizational Development:** Strategic planning facilitation, board governance training, and operational systems enhancement to strengthen Team Resurrection's institutional foundation.

**Program Design & Implementation:** Collaborative development of evidence-based youth programming, outcome measurement frameworks, and service delivery protocols that ensure effective community impact.

**Partnership Facilitation:** Connecting Team Resurrection with complementary community organizations, resource networks, and collaborative opportunities that expand service capacity and community reach.

**Financial Systems Support:** Administrative guidance on grant management, fiscal responsibility protocols, and sustainability planning to ensure long-term organizational viability.

Through our sustained partnership, Higher Self has observed Team Resurrection's exceptional commitment to community transformation and youth development. Your organization demonstrates strong leadership, community responsiveness, and the operational capacity necessary for successful grant implementation. The programming innovations and community engagement strategies developed through our collaboration position Team Resurrection as a highly effective partner for funders seeking measurable community impact.

Higher Self strongly endorses Team Resurrection Inc.'s grant application and confirms our continued commitment to providing capacity-building support throughout the grant period. Our established partnership provides a foundation for sustained collaboration that will enhance program effectiveness and ensure accountability to both community members and funding partners.

Our organizations share a vision of strengthened communities where young people have access to comprehensive support systems and meaningful opportunities for positive development. The partnership between Higher Self and Team Resurrection represents a strategic alliance that leverages our respective strengths—Higher Self's capacity-building expertise and Team Resurrection's direct service excellence—to create lasting community change.

Please contact me directly if additional partnership documentation or organizational references are needed for your grant application. We are confident in Team Resurrection's capacity for successful grant implementation and look forward to continued collaboration in service of community transformation.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
